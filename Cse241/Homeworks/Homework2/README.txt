For homework generally
----------------------
-> To execute game write `make` on terminal. 

-> You can place your move by writing (for example): G 3 (space is important)

-> After someone wins, game terminates.

-> To execute game again first write `make clean` to delete ".o" files and the executable file.

**otherwise `make` will warn you by saying `executable file is up to date`.  

For HW2 PART
------------

-> There are two saved games

-> Proper command is for both loading and saving is:

saving : "SAVE game1.txt" (without brackets)
loading: "LOAD game2.txt" (without brackets)

first game: "game1.txt"
