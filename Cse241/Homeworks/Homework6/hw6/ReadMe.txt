Welcome to Homework 6

- I prepared a Makefile so you can compile and run the file with "make"

- Addition to that, I added "make doc" command to create javadoc files for every .java files in the directory.
(I already added javadoc files into the zip file. but just in case I added the command.)

- Also "make clean" will remove all .class files from the directory

- This homework's test code would be so much longer if I'd tried to add every classes' every method. 

- So I tested only different methods for each class since same method's works same for almost all of them.
!(some of them throws exception so I tested them in exception part) 
!(if same method works different in other classes I tested it.)
!(if nothing is changed in the method, I skipped it.)

- This includes also exceptions.
