Welcome to Homework 4
---------------------

To compile the game write "make".

If it says: "file is up to date", then first enter "make clean" 
after that enter "make" to execute the game.


1) New Game
-----------

- When a new game starts you will choose board size and an opponent.

- To make a move first enter a column then a row (ex: A 11) !space is important

- Your game will be saved if you go to menu with or without finishing it. 

!! Since initially added games are in progress your first "new game" will be added as 6th game (and so on...)  


2) Continue to an existing game
-------------------------------

- All games will be listed here. 

- There are initially added 5 games when you execute the game. 

- All information you'll need before game selection, it will be shown to you (boardsize, opponent, moves played)

- To continue a game write the number of the game you want to continue

3) Comperision
--------------

- All games will be listed here as well

- To compare enter two numbers which represents their game number. 

- Example input: "3 5" (without commas)

4) Move Count
-------------

- Shows sum of move counts of every game.

5) Print Board
-------------

- You can see a game's board without playing it. 

6) In game commands
-------------------

MENU           : goes to the menu screen  
BACK           : takes last two move back
SAVE ____.txt  : saves the current game. can be loaded anytime with LOAD command
LOAD ____.txt  : loads the game with given name

** If you load any game without saving current one, loaded game's progress will be written onto current one. So all progress will be lost.
** You can't continue to any finished game. But you can still see the board in 5th section of the menu
