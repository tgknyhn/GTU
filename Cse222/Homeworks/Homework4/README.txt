Hi, this is my 4. Homework.
If you want to run the driver code to test both MaxHeap and BSTHeapTree classes you can write "make" to the console while you are in this directory.
To clean .class files you can also write "make clean"
Everything about this homework is explained in javadoc, report and code itself(with comments). 
Thanks.
