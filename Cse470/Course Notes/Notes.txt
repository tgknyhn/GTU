Active Attack  : Reading and changing the content

Substitution Cipher
* Letters of plaintext are replaced by other letters
* disadvantage : the last letters of the alphabet (which are mostly low frequency) tend to stay at the end
* ex: Caesar Cipher

Transposition Cipher
* Letters of plaintext are rearranged
* disadvantage : transposition can be easily detected by the cryptanalyst by doing a frequency count
* ex: Rail Fence Cipher

Unconditional Security
* No matter how much time and computing power is available, the cipher cannot be broken

Conditional Security
* Given limited time and computing power, the cipher cannot be broken

Symmetric Encryption
* Same key is used for encryption and decryption
* Fast
* Less secure
* ex: DES

Asymmetric Encryption 
* Different keys are used for encryption and decryption
* Slow
* More secure
* Example : RSA


1) Stream Cipher Encryption
2) Block Cipher Encryption
    - ECB
    - CBC
    - CTR
    - Output Feedback Mode

Mac & Hash
    - Message Authentication Code
    - Hash Function

Diffie Hellman Key Exchange
* It is used for changing keys in cryptography

RSA
- Açık Anahtarlı bir şifreleme yöntemi
- Two big enough prime numbers are selected (p and q)
- n = p * q
- phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
- e is selected such that gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1
- d is selected such that (d * e) % phi(n) = 1
- Public Key = (e, n)
- Private Key = (d, n)

AES
